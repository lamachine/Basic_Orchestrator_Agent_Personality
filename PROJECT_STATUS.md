  - [ ] Implement progress tracking for long-running tools
  - [ ] Create better output formatting

## Upcoming Tasks

- [ ] Implement sub-graph support
  - [ ] Create sub-graph framework
  - [ ] Implement personal assistant sub-graph
  - [ ] Add sub-graph discovery and loading
- [ ] Expand tool ecosystem
  - [ ] Integrate Google API tools
  - [ ] Add file system tools
  - [ ] Implement mem0 memory system
- [ ] Create web UI
  - [ ] Design dashboard layout
  - [ ] Implement agent status monitoring

## Used Ports

| Service | Port | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| KONG | 8000 | API Gateway |
| Brave Search | TBD | Needs new port assignment |
| Ollama | 11434 | Local LLM API |
| Supabase | 54322 | Local database |
| n8n | 5678 | Workflow automation |
| Grafana | 3000 | Monitoring dashboard |
| Open WebUI | 3001 | Web interface |
| Flowise | 3002 | Flow-based programming |

## Discovered During Work

- Need to implement better memory handling for Ollama prompts
- Consider adding versioning for tool definitions
- Database schema needs optimization for vector storage
- More structured approach needed for tool result handling

## Project Metrics
