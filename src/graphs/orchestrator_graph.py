"""
Orchestrator graph implementation.

This module implements the main orchestrator graph that manages sub-graphs and
coordinates their interactions. The orchestrator is the top-level graph and
does not need to implement sub-graph functionality.

Note: This graph does not implement sub-graph capabilities (like request ID chaining
and parent request tracking) as it is the top-level graph. For examples of sub-graph
implementation, see the template_agent's graph implementation which includes:
- Parent request ID tracking in metadata
- Local request ID generation and management
- Response preparation for parent graph communication
- Sub-graph specific state management
