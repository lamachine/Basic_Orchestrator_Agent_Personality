"""
Questions:
1. How does the state in here equate to langgraph's built-in state?
2. Why are we using JSONb to store to the database?  Also, where and how?  
   I see the decode section but not the encode section.
3. When task agents are running synchronously, do they only block their own thread?
4. What is astream in this graph?
Notes:
- results .run is syncronous, .run_stream is asyncronous
