Template graph implementation.

This module implements the base template graph that can be extended by specialty graphs.
The template graph includes sub-graph capabilities like:
- Parent request ID tracking in metadata
- Local request ID generation and management
- Response preparation for parent graph communication
- Sub-graph specific state management
