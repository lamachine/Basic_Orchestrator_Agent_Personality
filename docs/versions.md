# Version Control and File Restoration Checklist

We want basic functionality back.  We need to keep the refactoring for the config, but back out the rest.
Pulling previous versions with
    x.py the most recent,
    x copy.py previous, Finished refactor of config
    x copy 2.py oldest. Finished update and debug

We want to look for what was minimally functional, zen, and as simple as possible but no simpler.


## Core Files to Review and Restore

### 1. Agent Files
- [x] `src/agents/base_agent.py`
  - [x] LLM service initialization
  - [x] query_llm implementation
  - [x] Configuration handling
  - [x] Base agent functionality

  **No changes made**

- [x] `src/agents/orchestrator_agent.py`
  - [x] Review process_message method
  - [x] Check tool handling implementation
  - [x] Verify personality injection
  - [x] Review conversation state management

  **Changes Made (2025-05-08):**
  - Simplified process_message method while maintaining core functionality
  - Streamlined tool handling with async execution
  - Retained personality injection capability with simplified implementation
  - Improved conversation state management and logging
  - Preserved original prompt building logic as comments for reference
  - Added more detailed logging with [PROMPT_CHAIN] prefixes
  - Removed prompt_section from initialization
  - Added MessageType and MessageState imports

  **Known Issues:**
  - Message service integration needs review:
     - Error: module 'src.services.message_service' has no attribute 'add_message'
     - Root cause: log_and_persist_message function signature changed between versions
     - Copy version: Takes MessageState directly
     - Current version: Expects DatabaseMessageService instance
     - Impact: Message persistence fails due to incorrect function signature
     - Priority: High - affects core message handling functionality

  - [x] Check method implementations
    - [x] insert() - identical
    - [x] select() - identical
    - [x] update() - identical
    - [x] delete() - identical
  - [x] Verify error handling
