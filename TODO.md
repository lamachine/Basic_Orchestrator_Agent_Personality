## Refactor and Modularize Codebase

To refactor and modularize your codebase for better organization and readability, we can follow a structured plan. This plan will involve moving components into appropriate directories and creating test files to ensure functionality is maintained. Here's a detailed implementation plan:

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. CLI Separation
- **Objective**: Move CLI-related code to a separate module.
- **Background**:  CLI is only the first of three separate user interfaces.  The other two are a local web interface, and an MCP interface to offer this as a service.  
- **Action**:
  - Create a new directory `src/ui/cli/`.
  - Move the CLI logic from `orchestrator_graph.py` to a new file `cli.py` in the `src/ui/cli/` directory.
- **Testing**:
  - Create `tests/test_cli.py` with:
    - **Success Case**: Test that the CLI initializes and runs without errors.
    - **Failure Case**: Simulate invalid user input and ensure proper error handling.
    - **Edge Case**: Test with no user input or unexpected input formats.

#### 2. Tools and Agents as Separate Nodes
- **Objective**: Separate tools and agents into distinct modules.
- **Background**:  This graph has been greatly simplified.  Rather than multiple agents and many choices, there is only one real agent and tools that act like agents but have no LLM access.  Each of them will actually spawn a subgraph with that agents functions and tools.  Standard tools for customizing each agent's graph will be added in the standard way, as will specialized agents for certain specific tasks or testing.  The orchestrator is the template for all graphs but has the added function of interfacing with the user while the other agents are orchestrated by this main or central graph.  
- **Action**:
  - Use the existing directories `src/tools/` and `src/agents/`.
  - Move tool-related code to `src/tools/` and agent-related code to `src/agents/`.
- **Testing**:
  - Create `tests/test_tools.py` and `tests/test_agents.py` with:
    - **Success Case**: Ensure tools and agents perform their intended functions.
    - **Failure Case**: Test with missing or incorrect configurations.
    - **Edge Case**: Test with boundary values or unexpected inputs.

#### 3. LLM, Logging, and DB Services
- **Objective**: Organize LLM, logging, and database code into service modules.
- **Background**:  This is a standard way to organize code.  The LLM, logging, and database will be moved into their own respective services.  Additional LLM and database services will be added but local Ollama and Supabase services will remain primary.  
- **Action**:
  - Use the existing directories `src/services/llm_services/`, `src/services/logging_services/`, and `src/services/db_services/`.
  - Move LLM-related code to `src/services/llm_services/`, logging setup to `src/services/logging_services/`, and database management to `src/services/db_services/`.
- **Testing**:
  - Create `tests/test_llm.py`, `tests/test_logging.py`, and `tests/test_db.py` with:
    - **Success Case**: Verify that each service initializes and operates correctly.
    - **Failure Case**: Test with incorrect configurations or missing dependencies.
    - **Edge Case**: Test with large data sets or high concurrency.

#### 4. State Management and Graph Logic
- **Objective**: Refactor state management and graph logic for clarity.
- **Action**:
  - Create a directory `src/state/` for state management code.
  - Move state-related classes and functions to `src/state/`.
  - Ensure graph logic is clearly separated and resides in `src/graphs/`.
- **Testing**:
  - Create `tests/test_state.py` and `tests/test_graphs.py` with:
    - **Success Case**: Ensure state transitions and graph operations work as expected.
    - **Failure Case**: Test invalid state transitions or graph errors.
    - **Edge Case**: Test with complex state changes or graph cycles.

### General Testing Strategy
- **Continuous Integration**: Set up a CI pipeline to run tests automatically on each commit.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage to ensure all critical paths are tested.
- **Incremental Changes**: Move and test a few components at a time to minimize disruption.

This plan provides a structured approach to refactoring your codebase, ensuring that each component is modularized and tested thoroughly. Let me know if you need further details on any specific part of the plan!
